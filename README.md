# Operating Systems Class C++ Projects

This directory contains the C++ projects I created for the labs within the NYU Operating Systems classes. Each lab folder contains an assignment to simiulate some portion of a unix operating system using C++. 

Each of these assignments and the included lab descriptions were created by NYU Professor Hubertus Franke.

## Lab 1: Linker
This lab simulated the creation of a linker to link relative memory locations of multiple modules into a single executable. `linker.cpp` contains the C++ code and `lab1-linker-spring20.pdf` explains the assignment in detail.

## Lab 2: Scheduler
This lab simulated an operating system's thread/process scheduler using an array of different scheduling schemes. `scheduler.cpp` contains the C++ code and `lab2-sched-spring20.pdf` explains the assignment in detail.

## Lab 3: Virtual Memory Management
This lab simulated an operating system's virtual memory management unit. `mmu.cpp` contains the C++ code and `lab3-mmu-spring20.pdf` explains the assignment in detail.

## Lab 4: IO Scheduler
This lab simulated an operating system's IO scheduler of reading blocks from a disk. `iosched.cpp` contains the C++ code and `lab4-iosched-spring20.pdf` explains the assignment in detail.
